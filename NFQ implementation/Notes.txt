Version 0.1
- The agent does not improve
- Goes either left or right all the time
- ANN configuration does not matter for convergence
	- Have tried Rprop, Adam, SGD...
	- ...ReLu, Sigmoid...
	- ...2 hidden layers, 3 hidden layers...
	- ...layer sizes of 5 neuron, 20 neurons
- Using MSE as loss function
- Don't use any batches in training (all samples in 1 bacth each epoch)
	- Samuel Blad succeeded with a batch size of 1024. Mine does not improve at all even before I have reached that number of samples.
- Have not adjusted the reward anything
- Using one-hot encoding for the actions
	- Input to ANN is then 6 features
