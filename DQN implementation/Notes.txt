Low-dimensional state space:
- Very unstable
- Spend a LOT of time tuning parameters...
- ...to no avail since everytime I fitted Q_hat I fited it until the loss was low enough instead of just taking one gradient step
	- Should have understood this since the performance seemed better with a high loss_threshold parameter rather than a low
