CartPole-v1
-----------
Low-dimensional state space:
- Very unstable
- Spent a LOT of time tuning parameters...
- ...to no avail since everytime I fitted Q_hat I fited it until the loss was low enough instead of just taking one gradient step
	- Should have understood this since the performance seemed better with a high loss_threshold parameter rather than a low
- It did converge a couple of time with this errornous implementation though
- First somewhat reliable iteration: parameters_1.txt will converge around 1100 episodes or so
	- Still very unstable, when looking at the test performance during training
	- Tried reducing epsilon_min to 0.01 to see whether that would improve testing stability during training


Open questions
--------------
- What is our goal?
	- Suggestion: finding a policy that solves the task with as few episodes as possible
	- Suggestion: finding a policy that solves the task as reliably as possible
- When do we consider CartPole-v1 solved?
	- Suggestion: lasting an average of 495 timesteps or more for 100 consecutive episodes. Evaluated every 100 epsiodes
- What is reliability?
	- Suggestion: the variation (variance/standard deviation/quantiles) of number of episodes until solved over 5 trials
- MOTIVATION: 495 corresponds to failing 1 episode completely. 99/100 seems good (in the end, it's arbitrarily choosen).
